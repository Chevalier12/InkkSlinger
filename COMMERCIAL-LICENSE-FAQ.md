# Commercial License FAQ (10 Scenarios)

This FAQ is a practical guide for when the paid commercial subscription is
required. It is not a substitute for the `LICENSE`.

Rule of thumb: if you make money (directly or indirectly) from a product/project
that uses InkkSlinger, it is commercial use.

## Scenarios

1. I made a free hobby game using InkkSlinger and I do not take donations, run ads, or monetize it in any way.
Subscription required: No

2. My game is free, but it has ads (AdMob, sponsorship banners, brand deals, etc.).
Subscription required: Yes

3. My game is paid on Steam/itch/console stores.
Subscription required: Yes

4. My game is free-to-play but has IAP/DLC/paid expansions/subscriptions.
Subscription required: Yes

5. I’m running a paid closed alpha/beta, paid playtest, or paid demo.
Subscription required: Yes

6. I’m doing Early Access (paid) while still developing.
Subscription required: Yes

7. I’m crowdfunding (Kickstarter/Indiegogo/etc.) a game that will use InkkSlinger.
Subscription required: Yes

8. I have a Patreon/Ko-fi/donations that fund development of a game using InkkSlinger (even if the game itself is “free”).
Subscription required: Yes

9. A publisher is funding the project (advance / milestone payments) and the project uses InkkSlinger.
Subscription required: Yes

10. I’m a studio using InkkSlinger for internal tools that support paid commercial work (even if the tool itself isn’t sold).
Subscription required: Yes

## Notes

- Instead of a monthly subscription, you may be able to use the one-time
  perpetual commercial option (see `LICENSE`) if you prefer a one-time payment.
- Small studios with budgeting issues can request a written hardship waiver (see
  `LICENSE` / `USAGE-PERMISSION-POLICY.md`).
