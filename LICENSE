NON-COMMERCIAL LICENSE GRANT

Subject to the terms below, permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the
"Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute the Software,
in whole or in part, for NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.

COMMERCIAL USE

Commercial use is any use of the Software where you (or your organization)
receive money or other compensation, directly or indirectly, as a result of the
use of the Software.

If you make money from it, the commercial subscription (or a written
waiver/grant) is required.

Commercial use includes (non-exhaustive examples):

- selling a game/app/tool that uses the Software
- in-app purchases, DLC, paid expansions, paid mods, or subscriptions
- ad-supported releases (including sponsorships/brand deals tied to the product)
- early access, paid demos, paid playtests, paid alpha/beta access
- crowdfunding (Kickstarter/Indiegogo/etc.) where the funded project uses the Software
- Patreon/Ko-fi/donations where rewards or funding support development of a product using the Software
- publisher advances or other third-party funding for a product using the Software
- using the Software to deliver paid client work or internal commercial work

Non-commercial use generally includes personal learning, academic use, and
free/open releases that are not monetized in any way and are not developed or
used for commercial advantage.

Commercial use is permitted only under a paid subscription license, as described
below, or under a written waiver/grant from the copyright holder.

Commercial Subscription Tiers (monthly, in EUR; based on total company headcount):

- Small studio (1-5): 10 EUR / month
- Medium studio (6-20): 20 EUR / month
- Large studio (21-100): 40 EUR / month
- Corporate (101+): 80 EUR / month

Perpetual Commercial Option (one-time, in EUR; equivalent to 36 months of subscription):

Instead of subscribing monthly, you may purchase a perpetual commercial license
for your studio/organization.

Pricing is based on your tier at the time of purchase:

- Small studio (1-5): 360 EUR (one-time)
- Medium studio (6-20): 720 EUR (one-time)
- Large studio (21-100): 1440 EUR (one-time)
- Corporate (101+): 2880 EUR (one-time)

A perpetual commercial license grants the right to use the Software commercially
forever for the purchasing studio/organization, including in multiple titles and
internal products.

Perpetual licenses do not include subscriber priority support or any response-
time targets unless explicitly granted in writing.

Small Studio Hardship Waiver:
If you are a small studio and have budgeting issues, you may request a written
waiver for commercial use at no cost.

Commercial subscription grants the right to use the Software commercially while
the subscription is active, and to ship products that include the Software.

Subscriber Support (Priority Issues):

While your commercial subscription is active, you may request priority support
via the project’s issue tracker. The maintainer’s response-time target is
1-2 working days. If the maintainer cannot meet this target due to busy
schedules, medical issues, or other constraints, the maintainer will post an
explicit written status update as soon as reasonably possible.

Support and response-time targets are provided on a best-effort basis and do not
constitute a service level agreement (SLA).

Post-Cancellation Distribution Right:
If you cancel or stop paying, you may continue to distribute products that were
already shipped while you had an active commercial subscription, but only with
the last version of the Software you obtained while subscribed. You may not
obtain further updates for commercial use unless you re-subscribe or receive a
written waiver/grant.

high-quality bug reports, substantial bug fixes, reviews, or ongoing maintenance
