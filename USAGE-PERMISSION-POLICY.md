# Usage Permission Policy

This document explains how permission to use InkkSlinger may be granted by the
copyright holder.

## Default Rule

Non-commercial usage rights are granted by default (see `LICENSE`).

Commercial usage is available via a paid monthly subscription (see `LICENSE`)
or via a written waiver/grant.

If you make money from a product/project that uses InkkSlinger (directly or
indirectly), you should assume it is commercial use and that a subscription (or
waiver/grant) is required. See `LICENSE` for examples.

Commercial usage is also available via a one-time perpetual option (see
`LICENSE`).

## Requesting Permission

To request a commercial waiver/grant (for example a small-studio hardship waiver)
or custom terms, contact the maintainer and include:

1. Your name and organization (if applicable).
2. Project/game name.
3. Intended use (internal tool, shipped game, commercial product, etc.).
4. Whether you plan to modify the framework.
5. Preferred attribution text.

You can request permission via:

- GitHub issue in this repository, or
- direct contact with the maintainer.

## Permission Condition

If permission is granted, it is granted under this condition:

- The maintainer may list your studio and/or project title in this repository
  (for example in `README.md`) as an approved user of InkkSlinger.

## Scope of Permission

Any granted permission is:

- non-exclusive,
- revocable if terms are violated,
- limited to the scope described in the written grant.

If you need broader or different terms, request them explicitly and wait for
written approval.

## Contributions

Community contributions are welcome.

Contributing code does not automatically grant commercial usage rights to the
framework. Commercial usage still requires written permission from the
maintainer or a paid subscription (see `LICENSE`).

## Significant Contributor Commercial Grant

The maintainer may, at their discretion, grant a free commercial license to
individuals or studios who materially improve the health of the project
(for example through sustained high-quality bug reports, substantial fixes, or
ongoing maintenance help). If granted, it will be provided in writing.
